  This user flow ensures a smooth and intuitive experience by guiding users
  through key features like adding records, setting reminders, viewing
  transactions, and exporting reports. It enhances usability, reduces confusion,
  and helps users complete tasks efficiently.With clear navigation, filtering,
  and backup options, users can manage debts easily. It also supports
  scalability, allowing future feature upgrades without disrupting the flow.
  Strategic placement of monetization (e.g., "Upgrade to Premium") ensures
  business goals are met while keeping users engaged.
