    text: >+


      <div style="text-align: left">1.  **Lack of Interest in Traditional
      Journaling** – Young users find writing in a diary boring or feel
      unmotivated to continue.


      2.  **Fear of Judgment & Privacy Concerns** – Many children and teenagers
      worry that someone might read their personal thoughts, making them
      hesitant to write openly.


      3.  **Difficulty Expressing Emotions** – Some young users struggle to put
      their thoughts and feelings into words, leading to frustration or
      avoidance of journaling.


      4.  **No Immediate Reward or Engagement** – Traditional diary apps feel
      static and do not provide real-time engagement, making it easy for users
      to lose interest.</div>

    title: Challenges
    text: >
      The main challenges for this application are including to keep users
      engaged in journaling without the pet feature overshadowing its purpose
      and ensuring privacy and security for young users. Balancing gamification
      is crucial to maintaining motivation without turning the app into just a
      pet-care game. Additionally, as a small team, continuously updating pet
      interactions, animations, and dialogues may be challenging, requiring
      efficient content management.
